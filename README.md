# FAQ

1.  Why delays?
    Sometimes Assist is slower in its answer than the service performing the action.
    For example, we ask Assist to stop a timer. The service will stop the timer, then Assist will tell there are no timers active (instead of 'Okay, stopping the timer).

# Known bugs

1.  When stopping a timer, Assist currently responds with 'that timer is not running'. The timer(s) is/are stopped nonetheless.
